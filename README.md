# Python Basics Concepts

Welcome to the **Python Basics** repository! This repo contains a collection of Python programs covering the fundamental concepts of the Python programming language.

## Introduction

This repository is designed to help beginners understand the core concepts of Python. Each program in this collection demonstrates a fundamental concept, including syntax, data structures, control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming.

## Installation

To run these programs on your local machine:

1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-basics.git
   ```

3. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd python-basics
   ```

## Concepts Covered

The repository covers the following Python basics:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Numbers, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, etc.
- **Control Flow**: If-else statements, loops (for, while), etc.
- **Functions**: Creating and using functions, arguments, return values, etc.
- **Modules and Libraries**: Importing libraries, using modules.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files.
- **Error Handling**: Try-except blocks, exceptions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.
- **Recursion**: Recursive function examples.
- **List Comprehensions**: Shortening loops into concise list comprehensions.

## Usage

To run a specific program, simply navigate to the folder and run the `.py` file.

For example, to run the `variables.py` program:

```bash
python variables.py
```

Each program is designed to be self-explanatory with comments that explain the code logic and how Python concepts are applied.
